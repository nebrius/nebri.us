  <h1>Hi. I give talks.</h1>
  <p>
    Giving talks and workshops is a thing I'm really into. I blame having teachers
    for parents and my high school days as a theatre nerd :-P. Here's a mostly
    complete list of talks I've given, but I'm sure I'm missing one or two. If
    you saw me give a talk or workshop that isn't listed here, let me know!
